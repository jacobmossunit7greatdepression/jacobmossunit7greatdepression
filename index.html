                <h2>Unit Inquiry Statement</h2>
                <div class="inquiry-statement">The Great Depression and the New Deal highlight how systemic crises demand innovative governance and the balance between individual needs and societal responsibilities.</div>

                    <div class="question">Factual Question: What were the key causes of the Great Depression?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">The Great Depression developed due to several economic weaknesses that collided instead of one single failure, and the stock market crash in 1929 revealed deeper problems. This included banks that were unstable and poorly regulated, factories producing more goods than people could afford, and wealth being undistributed among fewer Americans. As consumer spending dropped, businesses cut jobs, which reduced spending even more. Additionally, the government's slow response allowed these problems to worsen instead of being controlled early.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">Conceptual Question: How does government intervention impact economic recovery and social wellbeing?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">Government intervention can shape how quickly an economy stabilizes and how protected people feel during a crisis. For example, when governments step in, they can regulate banks, create jobs, and provide relief that prevents a full collapse, however without intervention, fear and instability can spread. At the same time, too much or poorly planned involvement can cause resistance. This shows that public trust plays a big role in whether policies actually work.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">Debatable Question: Did the New Deal effectively resolve the challenges of the Great Depression? Why or why not?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">The New Deal did not end the Great Depression on its own, but it did change the situation in important ways. As a result, programs focused on relief and reform helped reduce suffering and made everyday life more stable for many Americans and permanently expanded the federal government's responsibility in economic and social issues. Even though full recovery came later, the New Deal shaped how the country moved forward. Honestly, I would say the New Deal was more effective at stabilizing and rebuilding trust than it is sometimes given credit for.</div>

                    <div class="question">Faith-Related Question: How do Christian principles of stewardship and care for others align with responses to economic crises?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">Christian values include caring for others, especially those who are struggling, and during economic crises, these ideas connect to actions. These ideas include sharing resources, protecting the vulnerable, and acting with responsibility rather than selfishness. These values reveal biblical teachings about justice and love, which can align with efforts to help reduce suffering during times like the Great Depression.</div>

                    <h3>End-of-Unit Reflection</h3>
                    <p><strong>Selected Format:</strong> Written Reflection</p>
                    <div class="answer-space" style="min-height: 220px; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">One thing that stood out across this unit was how the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, and the New Deal were all happening at the same time and making each other worse. For example, the Great Depression was not just triggered by the stock market crash. Problems like unstable banks and uneven wealth were already there, so when the crash happened, everything collapsed faster. Learning this made the crisis feel less sudden and more like something that built up over time.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Dust Bowl also added another layer that made recovery a lot harder, showing how the crisis was not only about money or jobs. Families lost land, health, and stability because of environmental damage caused by both drought and human choices. Seeing economic and environmental disasters overlap helped explain why so many people felt hopeless. This also explained why migration became so common.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, I noticed how leadership mattered more than expected. Hoover's belief in rugged individualism explains why early responses were limited, even as suffering increased. However, Roosevelt's approach was different. His fireside chats and new deal programs did not solve everything, but they changed how people viewed the government. This unit did not make the Great Depression feel finished or simple, but rather it showed how slow recovery really was. It also revealed to me why debates about government and actions still exist today.</p>

                    <div class="question">Factual Question: What were the main causes of the Great Depression?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">The Great Depression was caused by several economic failures happening at once. These included the 1929 stock market crash, and resulted in banks collapsing due to weak regulation, overproduction of goods, unequal wealth distribution, as well as a large decline in consumer spending. As businesses failed and banks closed, unemployment rose quickly, which made recovery even harder.</div>

                    <div class="question">Conceptual Question: How do economic policies impact global interactions and societies, as well as individuals?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">Economic policies influence how societies handle instability and how nations interact during crises. Poor policies can spread problems across borders, while coordinated policies can stabilize economies. On a personal level, these decisions affect employment, access to savings, and overall security. These effects are often felt most strongly by everyday people rather than policymakers.</div>

                    <div class="question">Debatable Question: Is the impact of the Great Depression a testament to the failure of capitalist economic structures? When might we see the next economic depression?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">The Great Depression exposed major flaws in unregulated capitalism rather than completely disproving it. The lack of safeguards made the system vulnerable to collapse. In my opinion, it was more a failure of oversight than a failure of capitalism itself. Another depression could occur if financial risks are ignored or global systems fail, although modern regulations may reduce the odds of it happening again, and with that said, no system is completely immune to crisis.</div>

It also reflects beliefs many Americans supported before conditions worsened and connects those beliefs to real policy choices during the early Depression.</td>
                        <td>The speech reflects Hoover's political goals rather than lived experiences since it was written before mass unemployment and poverty, limiting how accurately it addresses a national crisis.</td>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">It also shows that government choices matter, because when they procrastinated, it made conditions worse, while later programs helped stabilize society, even if they did not fix everything, because they acted early.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the long-term effects remind us that recovery is slow and unsteady. However, studying this period helps explain why debates about government responsibility still continue.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Dust Bowl is still relevant because it shows how environmental problems can build up then destroy people's lives out of nowhere. The combination of bad farming practices took away topsoil, and when dust storms and crop failures kept coming, families could not just wait it out any longer. A lot of people ended up leaving because staying meant no work and no stability.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">It also shows why government response and planning matters. At first the response was limited, and that made it worse, but later conservation programs and better farming methods were introduced to protect soil. That part is like the lesson people always mention, but it is still real.</p>

                    <p>Today, I connect it to drought and land use, but I am not totally sure how close the comparison is because modern farming is a lot different. Still, the main idea that you cannot push land forever without consequences feels relevant.</p>

                <h2>SECTION 1: Exploring Macro Concepts</h2>
                <div class="inquiry-statement"><strong>Inquiry Statement:</strong> The New Deal represents a transformative period in American history where the government took unprecedented steps to combat economic adversity, affecting various groups and altering the nation's political landscape.</div>
                
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">Factual Question: What was the 'New Deal,' and how did it propose to help the U.S. economy?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">The New Deal was a set of programs and policies under President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression that was meant to stabilize the economy and reduce hardship, especially around unemployment, bank failures, and basic security. This included job programs, banking reforms, and relief to help people survive while the economy recovered. The big shift was the federal government stepping in more directly to try to restore confidence and prevent a total collapse.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">Conceptual Question: How did the New Deal redefine the role of the American government in the economy and social welfare, and what implications did this shift have on the relationship between the state and its citizens?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">The New Deal made the federal government way more involved in the economy and in people's lives than before. For example, programs like social security and industry regulations changed expectations because people started seeing the government as responsible for keeping things stable and stepping in during emergencies. That also changed the relationship with the public, because citizens were not just left on their own in the same way during a crisis.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">Debatable Question: To what extent is it the government's responsibility to provide economic stability for its people?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">I think that the government has a real responsibility to provide economic stability during major crises and not just help a little bit. The Great Depression showed that if markets collapse, regular people take the hit the hardest, and waiting for everything to fix itself does not work. Also, programs like jobs and safety nets can keep society from falling apart. At the same time, stability also depends on businesses and individuals doing their part too, but the government cannot just step back, hoping and praying for something to happen.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">Faith-Related Question: How do the goals of the New Deal—such as helping the poor, providing jobs, and protecting the vulnerable—reflect Christian teachings about caring for those in need, and what responsibilities do individuals and governments have in living out those values?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space">A lot of the New Deal goals connect to the basic idea of caring for people who are struggling, especially the poor, unemployed, and elderly. Programs that provided jobs or basic support line up with the idea that society should not ignore people in need. I think governments can play a role by building systems that protect vulnerable groups, but individuals still have responsibility too, like helping directly and following the golden rule of loving your neighbor as yourself.</div>

                        <td>This matters because it shows how Roosevelt justified expanding social welfare in real time and not just how people judged it later, helping it connect the New Deal to the idea of government responsibility and how leaders tried to make that sound acceptable.</td>

                    <div class="answer-space" style="min-height:150px;">It probably made people feel more confident about social security because Roosevelt is presenting it as reasonable and necessary, not excessive.

                    <div class="answer-space" style="min-height:120px;">This is an educational feature article because it is not reacting to a current event.

The only thing that feels missing is how messy and uneven it probably was for real people, but that is more of a limitation than a disagreement.</div>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The New Deal is still relevant because it shows what government action looks like when the economy breaks down so badly that it is not casual business anymore. In the Great Depression, unemployment and bank failures hit ordinary families directly, like losing jobs and their savings, and there was not an easy way to work through it, no safety net. Programs like banking reforms, public job programs, and social security were meant to slow down the decline and keep people from getting completely shattered.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">It also matters because the New Deal essentially changed what people think the federal government should do in a crisis. Before the 1930s, social welfare was more limited, but the New Deal made government involvement feel more regular, especially with long term programs and financial rules, but you can still see that argument today any time people debate bailouts, safety nets, or what the government owes people during a recession.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the New Deal is relevant because it brings up the uncomfortable part of recovery and fairness, which are not the same thing. It did not fully end the Great Depression, but it did reduce hardship for a lot of people, creating protections that still exist. I do not think every program worked equally well for everyone, and I am not sure it even could have, but the idea of building a safety net is still a big piece of how the U.S. responds to major economic problems.</p>

                    <div class="answer-space">Leaders need to address the nation in a crisis because people need a clear message and reassurance when everything feels unstable. When no one official says anything, fear and rumors take over, and that can make the situation worse. A public address can explain what happened, what is known so far, what actions are being taken, and what people should do next, which builds trust. This is because silence can look like the leader is either absolutely clueless or just avoiding responsibility.</div>

                    <div class="answer-space">Strong leadership communication is clear, honest, and not full of confusing and fancy words. It should not exaggerate or be overly reassuring, but it also should not pretend the crisis is not serious. Good communication stays consistent so that people are not getting mixed messages, and it focuses on what the public actually needs to know. The best ones also sound human, not like reading off a script.</div>

                    <div class="answer-space">Leaders should communicate with empathy and care and not be practical. If they sound cold and blunt, people feel brushed off. This is especially when lives are being lost or changed. Empathy does not mean being unclear though, as facts are still necessary for people to respond the right way. I believe the best approach is empathy first with clear facts right alongside it, not empathy as an extra at the end.</div>

He consistently paid attention to people who were suffering or pushed aside, and he treated them like they mattered, rather than ignoring them or treating them like nothing. A lot of political leadership today can feel like it is about image, winning, or protecting status. Jesus is the complete opposite. His style is about being humble, compassionate, and stepping into other people's shoes instead of running away or avoiding their pain.</div>

                <h4>Analysis Questions Using All Five Sources</h4>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">1. How might these sources have influenced people's opinions, actions, or beliefs when they were released?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space" style="min-height:150px;">These speeches may have shaped how people reacted in the first hours and days of each crisis. Kennedy's address could build confidence that the government was in control during a global threat, and Reagan and Clinton helped people grieve with a calmer tone. Remaining calm can keep panic or rage from spreading as fast. Bush's speech pushed unity and determination right away, and lastly, Obama's address made the grief feel shared instead of something families had to carry alone. Together, they also set an expectation of how leaders are supposed to speak quickly and publicly during emergencies in order to maintain control.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">2. How does understanding the historical context change your interpretation of these sources?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space" style="min-height:150px;">The context helps explain why the tone and priorities shift between the speeches. For example, Kennedy is speaking during the Cold War, when the threat of nuclear war felt very real and possible, while Reagan is responding to a national tragedy connected to the space program, which is why his focus is on honor and meaning. Clinton is responding to domestic terrorism, which needs comfort and stability without turning it into bigger fear. Lastly, since Bush is speaking after a major attack on the United States, his message focuses on unity and strength, while Obama is responding to a school shooting, which makes his speech center more on grief and the human cost.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">3. How do these documents affirm or challenge current understanding of leadership in crisis?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space" style="min-height:150px;">They support the idea that crisis leadership is not just facts, but it is also tone, responsibility, and timing. You can also see leaders choosing what to emphasize based on what people need in that moment, and this may mean the goal is to create resolve or offer comfort. These speeches also show that leaders do not always share every detail right away, which challenges the idea that everything can be explained fully right in the aftermath of a crisis.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="question-block">
                    <div class="question">4. What new questions do these sources raise for further research?</div>
                    <div class="answer-space" style="min-height:150px;">These sources make me question how much these speeches affect the public's trust long term, not just how people felt that day. I also question if the same thing would happen now with social media and clips spreading instantly with live reactions all across the internet. Lastly, I wonder whether empathy or strength in decision making changes how the public behaves afterward, like whether people stay united or split apart.</div>
                </div>
                
                <hr class="section-divider">
                <h2>SECTION 5: So What? Why is this relevant today?</h2>
                <div class="answer-space" style="min-height:350px;">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Leadership in the midst of crisis still matters today for many reasons, because when something awful happens, people feel shaken and they look for something stable, and clear communication can reduce panic, especially when rumors spread faster than facts. Even if a leader cannot answer everything, a direct message can help people reassure others. This is important in reassuring people and helping them understand what is happening, and what steps are being taken.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">This is still relevant today as speeches can influence how people react in moments of crisis. One example of this is when leaders emphasize unity and shared responsibility. This encourages communities to support one another instead of blaming or dividing. The tone of the speech also plays a big role in how people process what has happened, and remaining calm and steady can help others pause rather than react purely off of emotion. As a result, this gives people space to think more clearly and reduce panic.</p>

                    <p>This idea matters even more today because messages spread almost instantly through news shows and social media. A single sentence can reach millions of people within minutes, for better or for worse. Because of that, leaders have to choose their words carefully and speak with empathy and from the bottom of their hearts. These speeches show that speaking clearly and with genuine humanity is what helps people feel grounded during a crisis.</p>
